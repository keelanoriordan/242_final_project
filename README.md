# 242-Final-Project

# rock and roll - Deadlines
> ## April 2 - 10%
> Youâ€™ll need to submit a one page writeup of the problem you are trying to solve. Include the goal of your project, description on the dataset and the plans for your deep learning explorations.

> ## April 9 - 10%
> Submit your jupyter notebook to gradescope. At this point you should have a working code that can train the network, demonstrated on at least subset of the data.

> ## April 16 - 10% 
> Submit your jupyter notebook to gradescope. At this point you should be in production mode

> ## April 25 - 40% 
> This is expected to be a 10 minute presentation to the class

# TumorVision
Folder with dataset, network, training, and detection code.  When each class if finished it will be uploaded to mypy.py so that we can import it into the other notebooks.  By separating each of the tasks we will prevent merge conflicts as well.

> ## Dataset.ipynb 
> Dataset class for both the CNN and logisitc regression network

> ## Network.ipynb 
> Has our CNN and Logistic Regression Networks 

> ## Train.ipynb 
> Use to train our CNN and Logistic Regression Models.  This will be uploaded to SAVIO

> ## Detect.ipynb 
> This will be the last script that will load in a model from Models folder and use it to test on images.  Use for deploying our models 

# Models 
All models will be save to this folder so we can keep track of our progress.

## CNN Models 
|Name|Train_Ac|Val_Ac|
|---|---|---|

## Logistic Models 
|Name|Train_Ac|Val_Ac|
|---|---|---|

# Submission
We will throw in the notebooks that we want to submit for each part of the project.
